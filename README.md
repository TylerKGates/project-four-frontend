# project-four-frontend

### This is for the front-end of my Gaming Forum Project.

This is a simple forum created for gaming. When the user clicks on "League Threads", it will redirect the user to posts about League of Legends (this has not been fully implemented as of right now), and so on and so forth with the other games listed. Anybody can view the posts, but only when signed in can a user create a post.

### Technologies Used
